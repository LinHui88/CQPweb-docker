Docker-compose yaml file for [CQPweb](http://cwb.sourceforge.net/cqpweb.php), starting from the dockerfile by [egon w. stemle](https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/commul/docker/teitok) from UniBozen (Sud Tirol, Europe).

From CQPweb's site: 
>CQPweb is a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for some elements of the CWB - and in particular, the CQP query processor. Thus the name.

>CQPweb is designed to replicate the user-interface of the popular BNCweb tool, which also uses CQP as a back-end. Like BNCweb, CQPweb uses a database alongside the CWB to provide extra functions beyond those built into CWB/CQP. However, unlike BNCweb, CQPweb can be used with any corpus.

>CQPweb is especially suitable for students, non-linguists, and others for whom a Unix-like command-line is a terrifying prospect.
